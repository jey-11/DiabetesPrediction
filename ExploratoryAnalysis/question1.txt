EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS: 

  The diabetes_prediction_dataset.csv file contains 100,000 entries of medical and demographic data of patients, indicating whether diabetes is positive, and labeled 1, or negative, labeled 0. The data contains various features such as gender, age, hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, BMI (Body Mass Index), HbA1c (Hemoglobin A1c) levels, and blood glucose levels -- where hypertension and heart disease are indicated present with a 1-label and 0-labeled otherwise. 
  These features give insight into how exactly diabetes was diagnosed as features like a higher BMI, HbA1c or blood glucose, for example, are linked closely to a higher risk of diabetes. HbA1c levels, the measure of an individual's average blood sugar level over the past 2-3 months, are considered particularly alarming as an indicator of diabetes if the patient shows more than 6.5%. On the other hand, another factor that suggests a risk for diabetes is a higher BMI, ranging from 18.5-24.9 as normal, 25-29.9 as overweight, and anything past 30 as obese. Interestingly, although these features are linked closely to patients being high-risk, only 36.8% of individuals diagnosed with diabetes exhibit an HbA1c percentage greater than 6.5%, and approximately 11% of individuals diagnosed have BMI of greater than 25, suggesting that other factors could also be playing a role in determining the diagnoses. Additionally, the data indicates that individuals with an age greater than 53 are more closely linked to diabetes, though the average age of the patients listed in the dataset is ~41.
