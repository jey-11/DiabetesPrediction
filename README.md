# Diabetes Prediction
CSE 158 Assignment 2



## Question #4:
Describe literature related to the problem you are studying. 

If you are using an existing dataset, where did it come from and how was it used? 
- The information in our dataset was sourced from Electronic Health Records (EHRs). EHRs are digitized records of patient data that contain large amounts of information, including medical history, diagnoses, treatment plans, and outcomes. EHRs are maintained as standard practice by healthcare providers and a very reliable source of information for a task like ours. The diabetes prediction parameters found in our dataset are tracked and measured by healthcare professionals, making it an optimal source to develop an accurate prediction model. 

What other similar datasets have been studied in the past and how? What are the state-of-the-art methods currently employed to study this type
of data?

Are the conclusions from existing work similar to or different from your own findings?
